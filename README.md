In this first realease i have included some common vulns that occur in apps.

## Vulnerabilities Covered:

- Steal Password ResetTokens/MagicLoginLinks
- Webview Xss via Exported Activity
- Webview Xss via DeepLink
- Intent Sniffing Between Two Applications
- Reading User Email via Broadcasts

## To Get started:
 - Install the APK from the [repository](https://github.com/jaiswalakshansh/Vuldroid/blob/master/Apks/Vuldroid.apk?raw=true) and play around
 - Find the areas where you think this can be exploited
 - I have also written a [blog](https://medium.com/@akshanshjaiswal/vuldroid-app-walkthrough-8f8e4511cad5?sk=45daf0e7fcf7de3f6a92fe8574c070a9) that you can refer as walkthrough but make sure you try yourself first
 - If you want to use your own firebase project for authentication clone the repo and remove the google-services.json and add your project one.
